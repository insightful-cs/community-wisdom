# Welcome to the Community Wisdom 

Being part of a few Customer Success and Experience communities, I faced challenge of useful information being scattered around at different locations. Important recommendations, discussions, documents/templates buried deep inside few threads. Need a better way to aggregate data, collaborate with other users and ask questions without losing context.

So I have created this repository to store, organize and version these knowledge information for easy and collaborative access.
